# TONY: Motive-Aware Diagnostic Grammar (Minimal Disclosure)

TONY is a falsifiability-ready scoring framework designed to quantify structural fragility and motive distortion across civic, financial, and AI systems.

## Core Premise
TONY does not interpret behavior post-hoc—it scores motive integrity *before* deployment. It functions as a machine-readable grammar composed of five modular evaluators:

- **SP** – Stylization Penalty  
  Flags rhetorical distortion and aesthetic framing that obscure structural truth.

- **ε** – Echo Contamination  
  Detects circular logic and internal repetition that simulate consensus.

- **ATTR** – Attribution Composite  
  Quantifies legal, ethical, and intellectual sourcing discipline.

- **DRP** – Delayed Reporting Penalty  
  Penalizes strategic latency between real-world events and public disclosure.

- **VO** – Volatility Overlay  
  Tests resilience under systemic stress and adversarial conditions.

## Deployment Notes
- Sector-agnostic: deployable across finance, civic oversight, insurance, and AI ethics.
- Stylization-immune: resistant to rhetorical mimicry and comfort-loop contamination.
- AI-ready: variables are machine-readable and falsifiable.
- Provenance-defended: timestamped to preserve authorship and diagnostic integrity.

## Status
This commit serves as a public timestamp of TONY’s diagnostic grammar. Full scoring logic, evaluator weights, and adversarial overlays are withheld pending modular release.

TONY is not a contribution to existing XAI frameworks—it is their successor.
