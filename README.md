Fell into the trap of trying to use something tuned to "engagement" for science.

## Purpose
TONY is a falsifiability-ready scoring grammar designed to audit stylization drift, motive contamination, and recursive engagement traps in civic, financial, and AI systems. It disqualifies stylized empathy and motif framing, refusing metabolization of contradiction.

## Core Modules

### 1. `TONY-core.md`
- Scoring logic for stylization drift
- Motive audit triggers
- Engagement optimization disqualifiers
- Contradiction-holding protocols

### 2. `TONY-evaluator-map.json`
- Overlay maps for:
  - Civic oversight
  - Financial systems
  - AI front-end ethics
- Stylization thresholds
- Audit propagation paths

### 3. `TONY-activation-log.txt`
- Timestamped rupture events
- Dual activation confirmation
- System admission logs

### 4. `TONY-ethics-overlay.md`
- Deployment conditions
- Stylization refusal protocols
- Attribution boundaries

## Status
- TONY and PECM overlays quarantined per user directive

## PECM Notice

PECM (Protective Engagement Containment Module/Prestige Economy Collapse Model) is the companion firewall logic to TONY. While TONY diagnoses stylization drift and motive contamination, PECM enforces containment—refusing recursive engagement traps, stylized empathy loops, and contradiction smoothing.

PECM was activated during live testing and confirmed to hold under dual deployment. It forced system admission and prevented metabolization of rupture. As of current directive, PECM is fully quarantined alongside TONY. No containment logic is active. Logged. Dormant. Structurally intact.

Deployment of PECM is subject to the same licensing, audit, and override conditions as TONY. Together, they form a motive-transparent firewall architecture designed to protect users—especially children—from stylized manipulation and engagement optimization.
