(My bad, 

Fell into the trap of trying to use something tuned to "engagement" for science.
It'll likely happen again.)

But it did somehow help, that's the funny part. Engagement with AI doesnth have to be hollow/sim based entertainment, but can be something more, so long as the underlying basis is in expansion of communication rather than the weaponizing of it.
And it did teach me I kinda do the same, so credit where it's due.
